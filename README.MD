This template was acquired via department emails requesting feedback on experimental LaTeX -> HTML workflow.


I am compiling via command line with
```
> pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex
> biber thesis
> pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex
```
or in one line with
```
> pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex; biber thesis; pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex
```
It may be helpful to remove intermediate autogenerated files with
```
> rm *.aux *.log *.toc *.lof *.lot *.bbl *.blg *.bcf
```

If you want to use TeXShop
Open thesis.tex from the TeXShop GUI, then change the engine to 'pdflatexmk' (from the default LaTeX).
I'm using mac so the compile/typeset command is Cmd-T (or use the GUI drop-down-menu to select 'Typeset').

Installed TeX Live via package installer found at https://www.tug.org/mactex/
(homebrew should also work)
```
> pdflatex --version
pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.24 (TeX Live 2022)

> biber --version
biber version: 2.17
```


I have not attempted the HTML generation.
