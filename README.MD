# How to build / typeset this document
I am tyepsetting via command line with
```
> pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex
> biber thesis
> pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex
```
or in one line with
```
> pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex; biber thesis; pdflatex -interaction=nonstopmode thesis.tex
```
It may be helpful to remove intermediate autogenerated files with
```
> rm *.aux *.log *.toc *.lof *.lot *.bbl *.blg *.bcf
```
The above commands have been added to a makefile for convenience. Call them from the command line with
`make clean` or `make typeset`.

# I just want to use TeXShop
If you want to use TeXShop,
open `thesis.tex` from the TeXShop GUI, then change the typesetting engine to **pdflatexmk**
(from the default LaTeX).
The LaTex might work but the bibliography and references will not be properly added.
I'm using mac so the compile/typeset command is <kbd>&#8984;</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>
(or use the GUI drop-down-menu to select *Typeset*).

For reference, I installed TeX Live (mactex) via the package installer found at https://www.tug.org/mactex/
Using homebrew to install TeXLive should also work. Here are the version numbers I have.
```
> pdflatex --version
pdfTeX 3.141592653-2.6-1.40.24 (TeX Live 2022)

> biber --version
biber version: 2.17
```

# I want to use Overleaf
I have not attempted to use overleaf. Maybe someone can document their workflow and send me a writeup?

# I want to output HTML
I have not attempted HTML generation yet.

# Citations
Put your bibliographic references in the file `references.bib` (referred to as a database)
and use the LaTeX command `\cite{my-article-name}`.
